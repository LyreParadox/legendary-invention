  <title>Why Learn to Code?</title>
</head>

<body>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Q1 - </strong><em>Why</em> do I want to learn this skill?</li>
    <p>I've been interested in graphic and web design for several years now. It's a skill that's very popular with folks who are location independent, since you can effectively do it from anywhere. There are (supposedy) lots of remote positions available, so I could potentially make West-coast money, but live wherever. I enjoyed the html class I took in University. Like being a VA, it's service-based rather than product-based. So there's a potential for high income if I'm efficient.</p>
    <li><strong>Q2 - </strong>What will I <em>achieve</em> if I learn this skill?</li>
    <p>I'll be abe to work remotely. I can use this to fill in slow periods in Notary work. I can do web development while traveling, which opens up the possibility for more travel.</p>
    <li><strong>Q3 - </strong>How will this skill <em>change my life</em> and career?</li>
    <p>I'll get a job at some company or non-profit as a remote developer. I'll be able to work while getting paid enough to actually have both <em>fun</em> and <em>savings</em>! The combination of tech & creative work may help me be more myself at work/play.</p>
    <li><strong>Q4 - </strong>How will learning this skill impct <em>the lives of my family</em>, friends, and co-workers?</li>
    <p>Mom will finally get back her second bedroom. Plus, then I can tell her all about the cool places I'm visiting that are #NOTINDIANA. Plus, I should be able to make auto-calculators for my friends D&D games. <em>(Which should please them to no end, the heathens.)</em> </p>
    <li><strong>Q5 - </strong>How will I <em>feel</em> if I never accomplish this?</li>
    <p>FOMO! Like I missed out on something that could have catapulted me into the future.</p>
    <li><strong>Q6 - </strong>What would my life <em>look like</em> if I manage to accomplish this?</li>
    <p>I'll be able to wake up without the stress of having to be somewhere by a specific time, have a relaxed breakfast, and get started on a project I'm interested in <em>(even if it's only interest in he problem of, 'How do I do this')</em>. Then I'd get stuck in for several hours before having to take a break to let my hind-brain work on a problem. Perfect opportunity to go on a hike with the dog, or do some dog training, or go for a swim. Then dig back in for a while, before wrapping up the afternoon and having some time to make a tasty dinner. Rinse & Repeat until I get bored.</p>
