        <li>Aside from color names and hex color codes, what is another way to encode a CSS color value? Give an example.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hex color codes typically have 6 characters that follow the #, with each set of 2 representing R (red), G (green), or B (blue), such as #ffffff. However, these two example hex codes are also valid:
            <p>#fff</p>
            <p>#ffffff44</p>
            <p>Why is this, and what do the two hex codes above mean?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          What does this declaration do to an element? margin: 10px 20px 5px;
        </li>
        <li>
          Two other common units for CSS lengths, aside from px, are em and rem. Briefly describe the meaning of each.
